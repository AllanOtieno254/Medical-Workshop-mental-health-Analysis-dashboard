# Healthcare Workforce Mental Health Analysis  
**Understanding Workplace Mental Health Trends in Healthcare**  

## 📖 Overview  
This project analyzes the **Healthcare Workforce Mental Health Dataset**, which contains **5,000 synthetic employee records**. The dataset helps uncover key trends in **workplace stress, burnout, job satisfaction, and turnover intention** within the healthcare industry.  

By leveraging **data analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling**, this project aims to:  
- Identify workplace factors contributing to stress and burnout.  
- Explore the impact of **Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs)** on mental health absences.  
- Predict turnover intention based on stress levels and job satisfaction.
